#+TITLE: Retrieval Functions

We will have a seperate namespace which contains functions which will retrieve:
  1. RSS data
  2. JSON data

Furthermore, it will prettify the data into list items that hiccup can use to
insert into our page.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (ns articles-app.retrieval-functions)
#+END_SRC

We will need a function to make a JSON call to the websites which output as
json. For some websites such as ~hacker news~ which return upto \(500\)
articles, we will only choose the first 10. Fortunately for us, clojure is
code-as-data which means our json data will be instantly operable.

Some websites will have their own functions since each API is different (hacker
news).

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (defn read-json [json-url]
    (slurp json-url))
#+END_SRC
