#+TITLE: Retrieval Functions

We will have a seperate namespace which contains functions which will retrieve:
  1. RSS data
  2. JSON data

Furthermore, it will prettify the data into list items that hiccup can use to
insert into our page.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (ns articles-app.retrieval-functions
    (:require [feedme]))
#+END_SRC

We will need a function to make a JSON call to the websites which output as
json. Some websites will have their own functions since each API is different.
First we'll make a ~rss~ reader since most websites have an rss feed. We will
use [[https://github.com/tebeka/feedme][feedme]] to read the ~rss~ in.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (defn read-rss [rss-url]
    (feedme/parse rss-url))
#+END_SRC
