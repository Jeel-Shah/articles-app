#+title: Handler

The handler is like the ~main~ for the application that we are trying to build.
We'll be using ~compojure~ to create our web server and [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][hiccup]] to generate the
html templates.

We'll also set up a simple db to keep track of websites for user (in this case,
myself).

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
(ns articles-app.handler
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]))
#+END_SRC

We can define routes by using ~defroutes~. We will only have one route for the
time being namely "/" because the interesting links should be at the forefront.
In other words, cut the bs and show me the goods.

For the time being, "/" will just return a simple string (for testing purposes)
however, that will be replaced by a function call to retrieve the posts from a
seperate namespace that we design latter.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (defroutes app-routes
    (GET "/" [] "Hello World!")
    (route/not-found "Sorry, that doesn\'t make sense."))
#+END_SRC

In order to run the app we need the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (def app
    (wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults))
#+END_SRC
